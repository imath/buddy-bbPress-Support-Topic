bbPress plugin to manage your support requests.

== Description ==

Once the plugin activated, go into your forums administration menu and define for each one of them if they will :

1. eventually accept support topic (default setting)
1. be dedicated to support
1. not accept support topics.


In the first case, a checkbox will be displayed to topic authors in order to let them define their topic as a support one.
In the second one, no checkbox will be displayed, and the topic will automatically be a support request.

For these 2 cases, once on the topic page, the author, group admin / mod, or super admin will be able to manage the status of the topics (Resolved, Not resolved..).

In the third case, no checkbox will be displayed and topics will be regular ones.

Since 2.0, the plugin requires **bbPress 2.5**.

Administrators are able to manage the support topics from the Topics backend menu. Once on the admin edit screen of a topic, in the first right metabox, they can change the status of the topic. They can also bulk edit support status from the list of topics using the edit bulk action.

It will work with BuddyPress (2.0) Groups forums (powered by bbPress 2.5).

It's available in french and english.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can i add custom support status ? =
You'll need to use a filter from your plugin or the functions.php file of your active theme. Here's a <a href="https://gist.github.com/G3ronim0/596e9e7fa6326c9ba592aec165dd08ba">gist</a> to illustrate how to achieve it.

= Does the plugin still work with BuddyPress legacy forums ? =
No, the plugin requires bbPress 2.5 which also works great to power BuddyPress Groups forums.
